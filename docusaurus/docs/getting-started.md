## Web Applications with node.js and React

Electrode was developed to make node.js and React.js a primary tech choice for developing applications at Walmart. It has been powering the <http://www.walmart.com> eCommerce website since 2017.

Electrode Web is a rapid application development framework; a full stack, end-to-end platform for developing, deploying, and maintaining JavaScript applications at Walmart.

### Quick start

#### Development on your local machine

To generate and deploy your Electrode app and Electrode components, install the following (if you have not already):

1. Install the [node.js] version 12.x.x or later

   - We recommend a tool such as [nvm] for managing node.js installations.
   - If you are on Windows, then [universal nvm] is recommended.

2. To build an app scaffold, run the following command in your console/terminal:

```bash
npx @xarc/create-app my-app
```

3. Wait for this to complete. The console will display the following with some instructions:

```bash
Created react/node webapp in directory 'my-app'
```

4. Follow the instructions outlined in the console.
5. When complete, open your browser to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
6. To stop the DEV server, press `Q`

Your new electrode app will appear as shown below.
