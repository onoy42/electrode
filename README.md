# Packages

This repo uses [Lerna] to manage multiple related packages that are part of the Electrode Core.

## App Archetype

This "app archetype" provides for common patterns across all app projects so that each app project can standardize on common development behavior and patterns. Its essentially pre-made patterns for build scripts.

## Yoeman Generator

The Yoeman app generator allow you to quickly create an Universal React App with support from the app archetype, and server in Node with Hapi or Express.

# Sample Applications

Some sample applications can be found under the `samples` directory.

## Boilerplate Universal React Node

Under `samples/universal-react-node`, this is a sample Electrode app that was created with the Electrode generator and consumes the Electrode App archetype modules.  We've added other demos and features to it to serve as examples.  It demonstrates usage with the following Electrode modules:

See its [README](samples/universal-react-node/README.md) for more details.
