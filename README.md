# Web Applications with node.js and React

Electrode was developed to make node.js and React.js a primary tech choice for developing applications at Walmart. It has been powering the <http://www.walmart.com> eCommerce website since 2017.

Electrode Web is a rapid application development framework; a full stack, end-to-end platform for developing, deploying, and maintaining JavaScript applications at Walmart.

Originally designed for Walmart-specific use cases, we decided to open-source electrode with the hope that it will be useful to developers in the JavaScript community.

This is the same version that is used to power many web applications at Walmart.

# Getting Started

Please go to our [docs](https://www.electrode.io/electrode/docs/getting-started) for further information and instructions on using Electrode.
