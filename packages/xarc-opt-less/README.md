# Electrode less style Addon

This is a feature package that instructs [Electrode](https://github.com/electrode-io/electrode) to enable less style support.

Just install it as your `devDependencies` and Electrode will detect it and enable less style support.

## Installation

```
npm i --save-dev @xarc/opt-less
```

> Note: **conflicts** with the old electrode-archetype-opt-less package.
