# Electrode preact Addon

This is a feature package that instructs [Electrode](https://github.com/electrode-io/electrode) to enable preact support.

Just install it as your `dependencies` and Electrode will detect it and enable preact support.

## Installation

```
npm i @xarc/opt-preact
```

> Note: **conflicts** with the old electrode-archetype-opt-preact package.
