# Electrode react Addon

This is a feature package that instructs [Electrode](https://github.com/electrode-io/electrode) to enable react support.

Just install it as your `dependencies` and Electrode will detect it and enable react support.

## Installation

```
npm i --save-dev @xarc/opt-react
```

> Note: **conflicts** with the old electrode-archetype-opt-react package and other React compatible framework addons.
