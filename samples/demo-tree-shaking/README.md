# demo-tree-shaking [![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url] [![Dependency Status][daviddm-image]][daviddm-url]

This is an Electrode sample app that demonstrates webpack tree shaking with Electrode component.

The app is generated using Electrode generator, and then added the Electrode sample demo-component.

To verify that webpack tree shaking is removing unused exports:

- run `npm run build` to create JS bundles in `dist/js`
- run `grep DeadCardExampleToBeRemovedByTreeShaking dist/js/*.js`

Note that nothing is found.
