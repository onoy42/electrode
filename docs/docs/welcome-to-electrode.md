Electrode is a platform for building large scale Universal React web applications with a standardized structure that follows best practices and has modern technologies built in. Electrode focuses on performance, component reusability, and simple deployment to multiple cloud providersâ€”so you can focus on what makes your app unique.

### Electrode Core

When building your React application with the Electrode Platform, you get an out-of-the-box app with defaults that make sense for the most typical use case, but if you need it, you have all of the following features ready to use with available options.

+ Everything you need to build a Universal React application with ES6 and JSX.
+ Prime support for building and sharing reusable React components.
+ Styling with CSS Module using [PostCSS].
+ Writing and running Unit Test with [Mocha], [Karma], and [PhantomJS] or [Chrome Headless]
+ Highly optimized Server-Side Rendering for your React App
+ Build a Progressive Web App out of box

## Subapps

Introducing Sub-apps, a powerful way to express small pieces of code as independent applications in the context of an uber main application. Sub-apps are just components, and if React is used, a React component. The goal is to not limit subapps to a framework, but at the moment React is the primary focus. Sub-apps help developers breakdown complex web applications into small units for them to be independently maintained and easily managed in large engineering organizations.
