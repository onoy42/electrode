# Create an Electrode Component

Electrode provides developers with generators that generate an Electrode component (except for generating an Electrode application). The open source generator `generator-electrode` contains a component generator `yo electrode:component` and a generator specifically for adding more components to an existing repository `yo electrode:component-add`.
