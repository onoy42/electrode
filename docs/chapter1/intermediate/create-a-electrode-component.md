# Create an Electrode Component

Except for generating electrode application, Electrode also provides developers with generators that generate an electrode component. The Open source generator generator-electrode contains a component generator `yo electrode:component` and a generator specifically for adding more components to an existing repo `yo electrode:component-add`.
