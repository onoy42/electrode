# Electrode React Component Archetype

Electrode Component Archetype helps developers to quickly build react components. Recently, electrode team made a significant restructure to the component directory using Lerna to manage component structure. With the new structure you can have multiple components inside of package directory and a single demo app to test all the components. Generally you keep one component in one repo, but you can have multiple smaller components that complement each other. Also, we moved demo-server to a directory outside of the packages, imported components from packages and demoed components through demo app.

Let's go through the most important sections to understand the new Component Archetype together and we will cover how to generate electrode components by using latest electrode generators in the next [Create an Electrode Component](/chapter1/intermediate/create-a-electrode-component.md) section.
