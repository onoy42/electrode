# Component Archetype Structure

In the previous component archetype, we used `demo-server` to demo and test the React component inside of the component itself, which adds a risk of confusion. To clarify, we removed `demo-server` for the component archetype to target the build, eslint check, and unit tests.

At the same time, in the [new electrode components](../create-a-electrode-component.md), we demonstrate components using `<repo>/demo-app` where we import components from `<repo>/packages/<componentName>`. The latest electrode components can be generated by the latest electrode-generator.

The new structure of the Electrode React Component Archetype is shown below.

```
- electrode-archetype-react-component
  |- config/
  |  |- babel
  |  |- browser_test
  |  |- dependencies
  |  |- eslint
  |  |- istanbul
  |  |- karma
  |  |- stylint
  |  |- webpack
  |    |- partial
  |      |- babel.js
  |      |- define.js
  |      |- fonts.js
  |      |- images.js
  |      |- json.js
  |      |- optimize.js
  |      |- sourcemaps.js
  |      |- styles.js
  |    |- webpack.config.coverage.js
  |    |- webpack.config.dev.js
  |    |- webpack.config.js
  |    |- webpack.config.test.js
  |  |- archetype.js
  |- scripts/
  |- archetype-clap.js
  |- xclap.js
  |- package.json
  ...
```

The Component Archetype still provides babel, eslint, karma and webpack configuration files as before, and the files can be found in the `electrode-archetype-react-component/config` directory. But there are some updates for the webpack configuration files, which can be found in the [Webpack Configuration](./webpack-config.md) section.
