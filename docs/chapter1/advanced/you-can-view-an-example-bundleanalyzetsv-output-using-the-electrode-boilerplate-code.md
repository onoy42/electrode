# Electrode Boilerplate

### Maximum Performance Out-of-the-Box

In our [Getting Started](/chapter1.md) section, we introduced you to our Yeoman Electrode [Generator](https://github.com/electrode-io/electrode#yeoman-generator) and we constructed an impressive application with the built in technologies that the simple `yo electrode` command gave us (read our Getting Started: [What's Inside](/chapter1/quick-start/whats-inside.md) to learn more):

-   [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/index.html)

This is the beginning foundation of the [Electrode Boilerplate](/chapter1/advanced/you-can-view-an-example-bundleanalyzetsv-output-using-the-electrode-boilerplate-code.md). You have learned in the [Stand Alone Modules](/chapter1/advanced/stand-alone-modules.md) section that each of the Electrode modules are agnostic and can be used individually to enhance one specific area of your application. However, integrated together, you have a supercharged application; one that is capable of handling the complex problems we face at WalmartLabs and reach maximum efficiency and performance.

This boilerplate includes the [Electrode Generator](/chapter1/quick-start/whats-inside.md) and it also has the following stand-alone modules and tools built in for peak optimization right out-of-the-box:

-   [Above the Fold Rendering](/chapter1/advanced/stand-alone-modules/above-the-fold-rendering.md)
-   [Server Side Render Cache + Profiling](/chapter1/advanced/stand-alone-modules/server-side-render-caching-+-profiling.md)
-   [Stateless CSRF Validation](/chapter1/advanced/stand-alone-modules/stateless-csrf-validation.md)
-   [Electrode Redux Router Engine](/chapter1/advanced/stand-alone-modules/redux-router-engine.md)
-   [Electrode Bundle Analyzer](/chapter1/advanced/powerful-electrode-tools/bundle-analyzer.md)
-   [Electrify](/chapter1/advanced/powerful-electrode-tools/electrify.md)
