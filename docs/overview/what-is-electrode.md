# What is Electrode?

> Electrode is a platform for building universal React/Node.js applications with a standardized structure that follows best practices and has modern technologies baked in. Electrode focuses on performance, component reusability, and simple deployment to multiple cloud providers—so you can focus on what makes your app unique.

### Core: Quick + Easy

Electrode Core allows you to build a flexible and universal React/Node.js application in minutes, with support for server-side rendering and easy deployment. Use Electrode to start new projects quickly with a simple, consistent structure that follows modern best practices.

The heart of the platform is the [Electrode Archetype System](/chapter1/quick-start/what-are-archetypes.md), which allows for a standardized configuration, structure and workflow throughout the entire application. By enforcing a sensible structure and consistency for components, modules and the entire app, Electrode’s Archetype system helps you build scalable applications you can trust while ensuring streamlined development and deployment.

**It only takes a few minutes to get your new Electrode application running and deployed to the cloud. See our **[**Quick Guide**](/chapter1/quick-start/get-started.md)** to get started now.**

### Standalone Modules: Optimize Where You Want

As part of the Electrode Platform, we have a number of modules to help with common tasks and features, from [server-side render caching](/chapter1/advanced/stand-alone-modules/server-side-render-caching-+-profiling.md) to [flexible configuration management](/chapter1/advanced/stand-alone-modules/confippet.md). These modules can be used independently of Electrode Core, which means you can [integrate them into your existing apps](/chapter1/advanced/stand-alone-modules.md).

**Start using these modules in your existing application with our **[**standalone modules guide**](/chapter1/advanced/stand-alone-modules.md)**.**

### Tools: Power Up Your Existing Applications

The Electrode Platform also has tools that can be consumed by existing applications built with other platforms \(though with Electrode core, these tools are either bundled directly or require far less configuration\). There are currently two powerful tools:

* one which enables [discovery of reusable components](/chapter1/advanced/powerful-electrode-tools/electrode-explorer.md)

* another to help optimize your [JavaScript bundles](/chapter1/advanced/powerful-electrode-tools/electrify.md)

**Start using **[**Electrode Explorer** ](/chapter1/advanced/powerful-electrode-tools/electrode-explorer.md)**and **[**Electrify**](/chapter1/advanced/powerful-electrode-tools/electrify.md) **in your existing applications.**
