# Requirements

First, let's quickly check your development environment. You will need to have the following set up to generate and deploy your awesome Electrode app in under five minutes:

## For Development On Your Local machine

1.  Install the latest [NodeJS LTS binary](https://nodejs.org/) in your machine. (at least v4.2 required, >= 6 recommended).
    -   Recommend a tool like [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#install-script) for managing NodeJS installations.
2.  Install latest (v3) of [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) with `npm install -g npm`.
    -   Note: NodeJS v6.x already comes with npm@3 by default.
    -   **Electrode requires npm version >= 3**
3.  Install [xclap] with `npm install -g xclap-cli`.
4.  The text editor of your choice downloaded with CLI tools installed.

> **We write NodeJS code with ES6 features that NodeJS >= 4.2 supports.**
>
> xclap is a Javascript build tool that lets us automate tasks.

## For Online Deployments

-   A [Heroku](https://signup.heroku.com/dc) account + [CLI tools](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-command-line).
-   A [Github](https://github.com/) account.
