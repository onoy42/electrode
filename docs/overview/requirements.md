# Requirements

First, let's quickly check your development environment. You will need to have the following set up to generate and deploy your awesome Electrode app in under five minutes:

## For Development On Your Local machine

1. Install the latest [NodeJS LTS binary](https://nodejs.org/) in your machine. \(at least v4.2 required\).
   * Recommend a tool like [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#install-script) for managing NodeJS installations.
2. Install latest \(v3\) of [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) with `npm install -g npm`.
   * Note: NodeJS v6.x already comes with npm@3 by default.
   * **Electrode requires npm version &gt;= 3**
3. Install [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md) with `npm install -g gulp-cli`.
4. The text editor of your choice downloaded with CLI tools installed.

> **We write NodeJS code with ES6 features that NodeJS &gt;= 4.2 supports.**
>
> Gulp is a Javascript build tool that lets us automate tasks.

## For Online Deployments

* A [Heroku](https://signup.heroku.com/dc) account + [CLI tools](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-command-line).
* A [Github](https://github.com/) account.
